# Web-site-shortening-service
It can help you shorten links to a few characters for a long link.
I used Phurl and changed it to open source. I removed it, translated all into English, and made some easy access settings for the user.
#Install
We need a server or a virtual host, a short domain name (as short as possible). The server needs to install nginx and set up the PHP.
We need to install Phurl first, clone the files locally, and upload them to the server or virtual host.
We first need to download the Phurl's unzip package, unzip it, and upload it to the server. After that, we need to go into the bound domain name and set it up.
After setting up the database and removing the "Install" folder as required, we can upload the coverage directly to the server and install it.
